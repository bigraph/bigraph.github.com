<h1>Bigraph 2013 Workshop Schedule</h1>
<p>The workshop will be held at the IT University of Copenhagen on Saturday 16 February, 9am - 4pm.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) building is located at Rued Langgaards Vej 7, in Copenhagen S (See on <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/sXVYh">Google Maps</a>).  The main entrance will be open, and signs will direct you to the appropriate room for the workshop.  ITU is a short walk from the DR Byen and Islands Brygge metro stations --- both of which are 2 zones from the central city, or 3 zones from the airport.  More details are available on the <a href="http://intl.m.dk/">Metro website</a>, or using the <a href="http://www.rejseplanen.dk/bin/query.exe/en">Rejseplanen</a> Journey Planner service, which can be used to find ticket prices and the best routes on public transport.</p>

<p>The workshop will be held in room 5A60, on the 5th floor of the ITU building.  There will be signs directing you to the room from the main entrances, or you can ask at reception if you need assistance locating the room.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>Talks are 20 minutes, with 5 minutes for questions.</p>

<p>If there are any problems with the schedule, please contact the organisers as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>There is no cost for registration - ITU has generously agreed to sponsor lunch.  If you are the author of a paper, or intending to participate, and have not already confirmed your attendance, please contact Gian Perrone (gdpe at itu.dk) to confirm that you will indeed attend.</p>

<h2>Social Event</h2>

<p>After the workshop, those who are interested in seeing more of Copenhagen are invited to take an informal walking tour of some of the famous Copenhagen tourist sites.  If you intend to join us for this, be sure to bring warm clothes and sensible shoes (it can be well below freezing in Copenhagen during February).</p>
